## ðŸ“˜ Module Overview
This e-Portfolio demonstrates my applied learning throughout the *Security Risk Management* module, showing how I integrated **ISO 31000**, **NIST SP 800-30**, **ISO/IEC 27005**, and **GDPR** frameworks with **quantitative risk-modelling techniques** to strengthen information-security governance within my workplace.  

The artefacts evidence both theoretical understanding and professional application through seminars, workshops, case studies, and quantitative exercises.

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Outcomes
1. **Identify and analyse** information-security risks using structured frameworks such as ISO 31000 and ISO/IEC 27005.  
2. **Apply** qualitative and quantitative methodologies (STRIDE, Monte Carlo, Bayesian analysis) to assess uncertainty and prioritise mitigation.  
3. **Develop and evaluate** business-aligned controls for continuity and disaster recovery.  
4. **Integrate ethical, legal, and professional principles** into security-governance decisions.  
5. **Reflect critically** on learning to enhance professional practice and leadership.

## ðŸ§  Professional Reflection
Throughout the module, I developed from a technically focused engineer into a **strategic cybersecurity leader**.  
Applying ISO 31000 and quantitative models improved my ability to deliver measurable, evidence-based risk insights.  
Collaboration and peer review strengthened communication and ethical awareness, while seminars expanded my understanding of AI, CPS, and GDPR governance.  
This portfolio evidences readiness to lead **data-driven, ethically grounded cybersecurity programmes** across enterprise environments.
