## 📘 Overview
This repository contains the complete e-Portfolio submission for the **Security Risk Management** module.  
It documents my learning journey, reflections, and evidence of applied knowledge across twelve units, following the **Rolfe reflective model (What? → So What? → Now What?)**.  
The artefacts demonstrate alignment with the module’s learning outcomes and University of Essex Online academic integrity policies.

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes Achieved
- **LO1:** Identify and analyse critically, security risks, threats and vulnerabilities in information systems.  
- **LO2:** Apply qualitative and quantitative risk assessment techniques (STRIDE, Monte Carlo, Bayesian models).  
- **LO3:** Determine and justify appropriate mitigation strategies aligned with standards such as ISO 31000 and NIST SP 800-30.  
- **LO4:** Integrate ethical, social, and legal considerations (e.g., GDPR, PCI-DSS) into security management practices.

## 🧠 Reflection Summary
The reflection demonstrates:
- Growth from a technical to a strategic understanding of cybersecurity risk management.  
- Application of quantitative methods (Monte Carlo Simulation, Bayes Theorem) to practical risk modelling.  
- Enhanced teamwork and leadership through group collaboration in Units 2–6.  
- Strengthened awareness of data privacy, compliance, and academic integrity principles.
