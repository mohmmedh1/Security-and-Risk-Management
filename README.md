# ðŸŽ“ MSc Cyber Security â€“ Security Risk Management e-Portfolio  
**Student:** Mohammed Ali Harahsheh  
**University:** University of Essex Online  
**Module Code:** SRM_PCOM6E  
**Academic Year:** 2025

## ðŸ“˜ Module Overview  
This e-Portfolio demonstrates my applied learning throughout the Security Risk Management module, showing how I integrated ISO 31000, NIST SP 800-30, ISO/IEC 27005, and GDPR frameworks with quantitative risk-modelling techniques to strengthen information-security governance within my workplace.  

The artefacts evidence both theoretical understanding and professional application through seminars, workshops, case studies, and quantitative exercises.

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Outcomes  
1. Identify and analyse information-security risks using structured frameworks such as ISO 31000 and ISO/IEC 27005.  
2. Apply qualitative and quantitative methodologies (STRIDE, Monte Carlo, Bayesian analysis) to assess uncertainty and prioritise mitigation.  
3. Develop and evaluate business-aligned controls for continuity and disaster recovery.  
4. Integrate ethical, legal, and professional principles into security-governance decisions.  
5. Reflect critically on learning to enhance professional practice and leadership.
