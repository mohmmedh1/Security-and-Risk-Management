## üìò Module Overview  
This e-Portfolio demonstrates my applied learning throughout the *Security Risk Management* module.  
It integrates ISO 31000, NIST SP 800-30, GDPR, and quantitative risk-modelling techniques into professional cybersecurity practice.  
The artefacts below provide evidence of both theoretical understanding and hands-on application through seminars, workshops, case studies, and risk simulations.

## üß† Professional Reflection Summary  
Across this module, I evolved from a technically focused engineer into a **strategic cybersecurity leader**.  
Using ISO 31000 and quantitative models improved my ability to present measurable, evidence-based risk insights.  
Group collaboration enhanced communication and leadership, while seminars deepened understanding of AI, CPS, and GDPR governance.  

This e-Portfolio showcases readiness to lead **data-driven, ethically grounded cybersecurity programmes** aligned with organisational resilience.
