## 1. Purpose

The purpose of this reflection is to present my personal journey throughout the *Security Risk Management* module — what I learned, how I felt, and how I grew as a learner and cybersecurity professional. It links theory to practice through artefacts such as the **Risk Identification Report (Unit 6)**, **Executive Summary (Unit 11)**, seminar activities, and tutor feedback. Each stage of this journey strengthened both my technical and leadership abilities, deepening my understanding of how structured frameworks, collaboration, and critical reflection shape modern cybersecurity practice and personal development.

## 2. Risk Management Process

Through this module, I developed a systematic approach to identifying, analysing, and mitigating risks rather than responding reactively. Initially, I viewed risk management as a technical task — installing firewalls or patching systems. However, after studying **ISO 31000** and **ISO/IEC 27005** (ISO, 2018a; ISO, 2018b), I learned that risk management is a *strategic and continuous* cycle of identification, assessment, treatment, and monitoring.

While developing the **Risk Identification Report (Unit 6)**, I applied ISO frameworks to classify risks across business and IT operations, realising that effective risk management must align with organisational strategy and appetite. Using structured models such as **STRIDE** and **FMEA**, I could distinguish threats from vulnerabilities and assess impact more consistently. The *case study by Hancock et al. (2024)* demonstrated how digitalisation introduces new risks requiring both qualitative and quantitative assessments.

The **Monte Carlo simulation** exercise in Unit 7 further enhanced my understanding of probability and uncertainty in decision-making (Olsen and Desheng, 2020; Aven, 2016). These tools helped me recognise that quantitative modelling supports better business communication and resource prioritisation.

## 3. Your Role in Team Tasks

During the group project, I led the **Risk Identification and Assessment** section, coordinating with team members to apply **ISO/IEC 27005** (ISO, 2018b) and validate our scoring system. My role involved ensuring that both technical and organisational dimensions — such as insider threats, policy gaps, and compliance — were reflected in our analysis.

A major challenge was achieving uniformity across contributions. To address this, I created a shared Teams folder and standardised the documentation format, improving traceability and transparency. **Peer feedback** commended my logical classification but recommended stronger justification for probability scores. In response, I incorporated data-driven reasoning from our **Monte Carlo** exercises (Olsen and Desheng, 2020), which improved our team’s credibility.

This task refined my ability to interpret complex data, lead collaboration, and communicate across technical and non-technical members. These leadership and coordination skills are critical for my professional growth, particularly as I aim to bridge technical analysis with executive-level decision-making.

## 4. Teamwork Experience

Collaborating in a multidisciplinary team was challenging yet rewarding. Early on, synchronising schedules and integrating different writing styles proved difficult. Through consistent communication via Microsoft Teams, we learned that effective teamwork in cybersecurity depends on collaboration and transparency rather than individual expertise.

Disagreements arose about prioritising risk likelihood versus business impact. These discussions, although intense, encouraged analytical debate. By referring to **Spears and Barki (2010)**, I learned how user participation improves decision acceptance and mitigates bias in security risk processes.

Seminar activities such as *The Role of AI in Risk Management (Unit 2)* and *CPS Threat Modelling (Unit 4)* further deepened my understanding of human-AI collaboration in risk analysis (Aijaz and Nazir, 2024). These engagements strengthened my communication, empathy, and adaptability — vital traits for coordinating cybersecurity initiatives across technical and managerial stakeholders.

## 5. Personal and Professional Growth

This module fundamentally reshaped how I perceive cybersecurity risk management. My earlier mindset focused on operational response — patching vulnerabilities or responding to incidents. Engaging with **ISO 31000**, **NIST SP 800-30**, and **ISO/IEC 27005** (ISO, 2018a; NIST, 2012; ISO, 2018b) shifted my focus toward strategic governance, integrating organisational context, risk appetite, and compliance.

The **Executive Summary (Unit 11)** was a milestone in my development. Comparing it with my **Unit 6** report revealed significant progress — from descriptive to analytical writing, grounded in quantitative models and managerial logic. Tutor feedback highlighted how aligning technical insights with business outcomes improves clarity and stakeholder engagement (Campbell, 2016).

Personally, I improved my **time management**, **critical thinking**, and **communication skills**. I now ensure each technical decision supports business continuity and aligns with institutional resilience goals. This transformation strengthened my ambition to advance into a cybersecurity leadership role where I can integrate governance, risk, and compliance frameworks effectively.

## 6. Conclusion (Rolfe’s Model)

Reflecting on this module revealed how my perspective shifted from purely technical execution to holistic strategic thinking.

**What?** — I learned structured frameworks, quantitative modelling, and collaborative leadership through real assessments and seminars.
**So What?** — These experiences showed me that effective cybersecurity management extends beyond control implementation to include communication, ethics, and decision-making aligned with organisational priorities. I recognised that risk is not only about vulnerabilities but about balancing opportunities and resilience.
**Now What?** — I intend to apply these lessons by leading digital infrastructure governance projects within my institution. My goal is to integrate risk frameworks like ISO 31000 and NIST 800-30 into operational processes, ensuring data protection, compliance, and business continuity.

This reflection consolidates my evolution from a technically focused engineer into a security strategist who can design, communicate, and implement proactive risk governance.
