Unit 12 Seminar – The Great Debate: The Future of Security Risk Management (SRM)

Title: The Great Debate – The Future of SRM

1. Selected Trend: Artificial Intelligence in Cyber Risk Management

Our team chose Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) as the most influential trend shaping SRM in the next five years. AI is transforming how organisations detect, assess, and mitigate security risks by automating data analysis, anomaly detection, and predictive modelling. Tools like Microsoft Security Copilot and Darktrace already demonstrate adaptive threat response capabilities, supporting faster and more accurate decision-making.

AI also enables risk quantification through continuous monitoring of network baselines, user behaviour, and vulnerability trends. As threat actors increasingly exploit automation and AI-driven malware, security teams must embrace the same technologies for defensive parity.

2. Key Arguments Presented by the Team

Enhanced Risk Prediction: AI algorithms process large datasets to identify emerging threats and simulate attack patterns in real time, improving situational awareness.

Adaptive Response: Machine learning models refine incident response playbooks by learning from past events and integrating with SOAR and NDR platforms.

Reduced Human Error: Automating repetitive security tasks allows analysts to focus on critical investigations and governance decisions.

Integration with Frameworks: AI-driven analytics align with ISO 31000 and NIST RMF principles by strengthening continuous risk assessment and control validation.

Ethical and Governance Challenges: The team discussed the dual-use dilemma of AI — while improving defence, it can also enhance attacker sophistication. This emphasises the importance of AI ethics, transparency, and accountability in security systems.

3. Summary of Class Debate and Poll Outcome

The debate featured multiple trends, including Zero Trust Architecture, Quantum-Resistant Cryptography, and AI-Driven SRM. While Zero Trust emphasised identity-based verification and network segmentation, AI was argued to have broader strategic impact due to its cross-domain applicability.

During the tutor-led poll, AI in SRM received the majority vote as the most influential future trend, primarily for its ability to enhance predictive analytics, automate risk detection, and adapt to evolving threats.

4. Reflection

Participating in the debate deepened my understanding of how AI integrates with risk frameworks to revolutionise security operations. Before this activity, I viewed AI primarily as a tool for automation; now, I see its strategic potential for predictive and adaptive security governance. The discussion highlighted the ethical and legal implications of algorithmic bias, data privacy, and transparency in automated decision-making.

This activity strengthened my analytical and presentation skills, particularly in evaluating future technologies from technical and governance perspectives. I now plan to integrate AI-driven analytics within risk management processes at my workplace, aligning with ISO 31000 principles to improve resilience and data-driven decision-making.
