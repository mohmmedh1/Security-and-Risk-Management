Unit 6 Summary – Security Standards Seminar

Purpose:
To explore key information security standards (GDPR, PCI-DSS, HIPAA) and evaluate how they apply to the company scenario used in the module assessment.

Main Standards Reviewed:

GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation): Protects EU residents’ personal data — relevant to any organisation operating in or serving the EU.

PCI-DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard): Ensures secure processing and storage of cardholder data for online payment systems.

HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act): U.S. healthcare data protection standard — referenced for its governance and audit principles.

Evaluation Findings:

The company must comply with GDPR and PCI-DSS due to its European operations and online payment processing.

Key compliance gaps include lack of data retention policies, access controls, and documented audit trails.

HIPAA-style logging and accountability measures could enhance internal governance even if not legally required.

Recommendations:

Establish a unified compliance framework combining GDPR and PCI-DSS controls.

Implement encryption, MFA, and RBAC to secure user and payment data.

Conduct regular audits, staff training, and vendor compliance checks.

Assign a Data Protection Officer (DPO) and maintain incident response procedures.

Assumptions:

The company handles both EU personal data and online transactions.

Cloud-based systems are used, requiring shared compliance responsibility.

No healthcare data is processed (HIPAA applied only as best practice).

Reflection:
This activity clarified how international standards overlap to ensure confidentiality, integrity, and accountability. I learned that true compliance is not just a checklist — it’s an ongoing process integrating legal, technical, and organisational perspectives. This understanding enhanced my ability to evaluate business systems through a risk-and-governance lens, directly supporting my professional development as a cybersecurity leader.
