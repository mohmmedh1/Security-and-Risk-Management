Unit 7 Summary – Quantitative Risk Modelling

Purpose:

This unit introduced quantitative approaches to cybersecurity risk management through practical exercises in Monte Carlo simulation and Bayesian probability analysis. The goal was to model uncertainty, evaluate risk probability, and apply data-driven decision-making in real-world security scenarios.

Activities Completed:

Monte Carlo Simulation in Excel (Winston, 2020)

Created random variables to represent uncertain risk factors such as failure rates and downtime.

Simulated thousands of outcomes using Excel’s data table and RAND functions.

Analysed frequency distributions to determine mean risk exposure and potential impact ranges.

Applied findings to security context — e.g., estimating likelihood of server downtime or data breach probability.

Bayesian Analysis in Python (Downey, 2020)

Completed Think Bayes 2 exercises (Chapters 1–2) using Jupyter Notebook (chap01.ipynb, chap02.ipynb) with helper functions from utils.py.

Modelled prior and posterior probabilities to simulate how risk perception changes with new evidence.

Tested Bayesian inference to update the likelihood of attack success after multiple threat detections.

Demonstrated how statistical reasoning supports adaptive cybersecurity strategies.

Key Learning Points:

Monte Carlo simulations allow for quantitative risk estimation by repeatedly sampling uncertain variables.

Bayesian models enable continuous updating of threat likelihood based on observed evidence.

Both methods complement traditional qualitative risk assessments, offering evidence-based decision-making aligned with ISO 31000 and NIST 800-30 frameworks.

Quantitative risk modelling bridges the gap between technical analysis and executive-level reporting.

Reflection (≈150 words):

Before this unit, I mainly relied on qualitative judgment when assessing risks. Through these exercises, I developed a more analytical mindset that treats uncertainty as measurable and manageable. The Monte Carlo simulation clarified how small changes in input probabilities can significantly alter risk outcomes, while Bayesian reasoning taught me how evidence reshapes threat perception dynamically. Working through the Python notebooks improved my coding and statistical thinking, allowing me to present risks in terms of probability distributions rather than subjective scales. This experience enhanced my capability to integrate statistical models into cybersecurity governance, supporting data-driven strategies for resilience and informed decision-making.
