## ðŸ§  Workshop Activity â€“ Questions and Answers  

### **Q1.** What are the key elements and interdependencies in a cyber-physical system (CPS) that must be captured in a comprehensive threat model, and why are they critical for accurate risk analysis?

According to *Jbair et al. (2022)*, effective CPS threat modelling must capture **physical components**, **communication channels**, **control logic**, and **humanâ€“machine interactions**. These elements represent the layered architecture of energy systems where digital operations directly influence physical processes.  

Interdependencies â€” such as links between sensors, controllers, and actuators â€” are vital because they show how a single point of failure can cascade through the entire system.  
For example, if a compromised sensor feeds manipulated data into a SCADA subsystem, both operational safety and power stability could be jeopardised.  

Recognising these dependencies helps analysts predict not just isolated incidents but also **propagating attack chains**, a core concept in modern cyber-physical risk assessment (*Humayed et al., 2017*).

### **Q2.** How can threat modelling help identify attack entry points and system vulnerabilities in cyber-physical energy systems, and what are the challenges in doing so effectively?

Threat modelling provides a structured method to map **entry points** such as communication interfaces, control ports, wireless links, and third-party integrations.  
Techniques like **Data Flow Diagrams (DFDs)** and **STRIDE** enable analysts to visualise how data moves across systems and where potential breaches could occur (*Microsoft, 2023*).  

In CPS, this reveals how attackers might exploit insecure protocols (e.g., Modbus TCP, DNP3) to manipulate control logic or inject false data.  
Challenges include system complexity, legacy components, and real-time constraints where patching or downtime may not be feasible (*Knowles et al., 2015*).  

The increased interconnectivity between IT and operational systems further expands the attack surface, demanding collaboration across **engineering and cybersecurity disciplines**.

### **Q3.** In the context of CPS threat modelling, how can scenario-specific metrics and risk assessment methodologies be used to prioritise vulnerabilities and guide the development of targeted security countermeasures?

Scenario-specific metrics enable quantification of risk through impact and likelihood scores, tailored to contextual factors such as **energy distribution disruption**, **fault propagation rate**, or **detection latency**.  

Frameworks like **NIST SP 800-30** and **ISO/IEC 27005** can be adapted for CPS by integrating these parameters (*NIST, 2012; ISO, 2018*).  
Assigning weights to such metrics helps prioritise high-impact vulnerabilities â€” for example, an unauthenticated control interface poses a greater operational risk than a passive monitoring node.  

*Jbair et al. (2022)* emphasise that these structured assessments not only enhance technical precision but also enable **efficient resource allocation** and design of **targeted mitigation strategies** such as redundant control paths, anomaly detection, or automated isolation protocols.

## ðŸ’¬ Reflection  

This case study reinforced the importance of **holistic threat modelling** in cyber-physical environments.  
I learned that genuine resilience depends not only on defending digital assets but also on understanding **physical interconnections** and **operational dependencies**.  

By analysing CPS systems, I recognised that cybersecurity must integrate **engineering perspectives**â€”an insight I can directly apply within my workplace to improve protection of critical infrastructure.  

This exercise enhanced my **analytical thinking** and ability to connect **quantitative metrics** with **real-world operational outcomes**, bridging theory and practice.
