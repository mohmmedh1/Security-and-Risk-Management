## 🧠 Professional Reflection  
Throughout the module, I developed from a technically focused engineer into a strategic cybersecurity leader.  
Applying ISO 31000 and quantitative models improved my ability to deliver measurable, evidence-based risk insights.  
Collaboration and peer review strengthened communication and ethical awareness, while seminars expanded my understanding of AI, CPS, and GDPR governance.  
This portfolio evidences readiness to lead data-driven, ethically grounded cybersecurity programmes across enterprise environments.
