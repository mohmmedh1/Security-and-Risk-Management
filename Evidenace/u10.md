1. Key Concepts in DR Solution Design

Both Sutton (2021) and Popov et al. (2016) emphasise that effective DR design requires strategic alignment with business continuity planning and risk-based prioritisation of systems. Sutton outlines that DR should focus on availability, redundancy, and resilience, supported by technologies like replication, virtualisation, and cloud failover.

Popov et al. extend this by introducing the Bow-Tie Risk Analysis Model, linking preventive and recovery controls to threat and consequence pathways. This model helps identify weak points and design layered controls — essential for DR architectures in hybrid or cloud environments.

2. Evaluating and Testing DR Plans

A recurring theme across both readings is that untested plans are unreliable. Sutton (2021) advises regular failover simulations, data integrity tests, and dependency mapping to ensure that DR capabilities align with Recovery Time Objectives (RTOs) and Recovery Point Objectives (RPOs).

Popov et al. (2016) argue that the frequency of testing should correlate with system criticality, adopting a quantitative risk-based approach. Continuous review cycles, combined with lessons learned from exercises, enable adaptive improvement and ensure that DR remains current with business and technological changes.

3. Integration of Risk Assessment into DR Design

Integrating risk assessment results into DR design ensures that high-impact threats receive priority mitigation. Both sources recommend using quantitative models to rank critical services and dependencies. Popov et al. highlight how probabilistic analysis supports informed investment decisions in redundancy or automation.

Sutton (2021) further illustrates that risk-informed DR planning strengthens incident response by linking technical recovery with organisational decision-making. The integration of DR into enterprise risk management systems (such as ISO 22301 and ISO 27001) enhances transparency and compliance.

4. Reflection (≈120 words)

This seminar helped me connect risk management theory with practical disaster recovery design. I learned that DR solutions are not simply technical recovery mechanisms but part of a broader resilience strategy. Sutton’s discussion of layered redundancy and testing reinforced the need for dynamic, continuously validated recovery processes. Popov’s Bow-Tie model clarified how preventive and corrective measures complement each other in reducing downtime risk.

From this learning, I plan to adopt a risk-driven, test-centric approach in DR planning within my workplace — ensuring RTOs and RPOs are achievable, dependencies are clearly mapped, and recovery testing becomes part of the operational culture rather than an occasional audit requirement.
