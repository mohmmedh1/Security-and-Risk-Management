# 🧩 Unit 7: Quantitative Risk Modelling  

**Purpose:**  
This unit introduced **quantitative approaches** to cybersecurity risk management through practical exercises in **Monte Carlo simulation** and **Bayesian probability analysis**.  
The objective was to model uncertainty, evaluate risk probability, and apply **data-driven decision-making** in real-world security scenarios.

## 🧠 Activities Completed  

### 🔹 Monte Carlo Simulation in Excel (*Winston, 2020*)  
- Created random variables representing uncertain factors such as **failure rates** and **downtime**.  
- Simulated thousands of outcomes using Excel’s **RAND()** and data-table functions.  
- Analysed **frequency distributions** to identify mean risk exposure and potential impact ranges.  
- Applied results to cybersecurity contexts — for example, estimating **server downtime likelihood** or **data-breach probability**.  

### 🔹 Bayesian Analysis in Python (*Downey, 2020*)  
- Completed *Think Bayes 2* exercises (Chapters 1–2) using Jupyter Notebook (`chap01.ipynb`, `chap02.ipynb`) supported by custom helper functions (`utils.py`).  
- Modelled **prior and posterior probabilities** to simulate how risk perception changes as new evidence emerges.  
- Tested **Bayesian inference** to update attack-success probabilities after multiple detections.  
- Demonstrated how **statistical reasoning** strengthens adaptive cybersecurity decision-making.

## 📊 Key Learning Points  

- **Monte Carlo simulations** quantify uncertainty by repeatedly sampling risk variables, offering a data-driven view of potential outcomes.  
- **Bayesian models** enable continuous updating of threat likelihood based on observed evidence, reflecting real-time intelligence.  
- Both techniques complement qualitative frameworks (e.g. **ISO 31000**, **NIST SP 800-30**) by adding **mathematical precision** to risk estimation.  
- Quantitative modelling bridges the gap between **technical analysis** and **executive-level reporting**, enhancing strategic governance.

## 💬 Reflection  

Before this unit, I mainly relied on qualitative judgment when assessing risks.  
Through these exercises, I developed a more analytical mindset that treats **uncertainty as measurable and manageable**.  

The **Monte Carlo simulation** demonstrated how small variations in input probabilities can significantly affect outcomes, while **Bayesian reasoning** showed how evidence dynamically reshapes threat perception.  
Working through the Python notebooks strengthened my **coding**, **statistical**, and **interpretive** skills, enabling me to express risks in terms of **probability distributions** rather than subjective scales.  

This experience elevated my capability to integrate **quantitative models** into cybersecurity governance, advancing **data-driven resilience** and **evidence-based decision-making** across organisational contexts.
