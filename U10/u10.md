## üß† 1. Key Concepts in DR Solution Design  

Both *Sutton (2021)* and *Popov et al. (2016)* emphasise that effective DR design requires strategic alignment with business-continuity planning and risk-based prioritisation of systems.  
Sutton outlines that DR should focus on **availability, redundancy, and resilience**, supported by technologies such as replication, virtualisation, and cloud failover.  

Popov et al. extend this by introducing the **Bow-Tie Risk Analysis Model**, which links preventive and recovery controls to threat-and-consequence pathways.  
This model exposes weak points and guides the design of layered controls ‚Äî an essential practice for hybrid or cloud-based DR architectures.

## üß© 2. Evaluating and Testing DR Plans  

A recurring theme across both readings is that **untested plans are unreliable**.  
*Sutton (2021)* advises regular **failover simulations**, **data-integrity tests**, and **dependency mapping** to ensure that DR capabilities align with Recovery Time Objectives (RTOs) and Recovery Point Objectives (RPOs).  

*Popov et al. (2016)* argue that testing frequency should correlate with system criticality, adopting a **quantitative, risk-based** approach.  
Continuous review cycles, supported by lessons learned from exercises, drive adaptive improvement and ensure that DR strategies evolve alongside business and technology changes.

## ‚öôÔ∏è 3. Integration of Risk Assessment into DR Design  

Integrating **risk-assessment outcomes** into DR design ensures that high-impact threats receive prioritised mitigation.  
Both sources recommend using quantitative models to rank critical services and dependencies.  
*Popov et al.* highlight that **probabilistic analysis** enables informed investment in redundancy and automation.  

*Sutton (2021)* demonstrates that **risk-informed DR planning** strengthens incident response by linking technical recovery to organisational decision-making.  
Embedding DR into enterprise risk-management frameworks such as **ISO 22301** and **ISO 27001** enhances transparency and regulatory compliance.

## üí¨ 4. Reflection  

This seminar connected risk-management theory with the **practical design of disaster-recovery solutions**.  
I realised that DR is not just a technical recovery mechanism but a cornerstone of organisational resilience.  
Sutton‚Äôs focus on layered redundancy and continuous testing reinforced the importance of a **dynamic, validated** recovery process.  
Popov‚Äôs Bow-Tie Model clarified how preventive and corrective measures complement each other to reduce downtime risk.  

Moving forward, I will adopt a **risk-driven, test-centric approach** in DR planning within my workplace ‚Äî ensuring that RTOs and RPOs are realistic, dependencies are mapped, and testing becomes a routine cultural practice rather than an occasional audit requirement.
