## üß† 1. Overview

This unit focused on conducting a collaborative **risk identification and assessment** for *Pampered Pets Ltd.*, a small enterprise exploring digitalisation. The task required assessing both current and digitalised business models, identifying threats, and recommending mitigation strategies based on **ISO 31000**, **ISO/IEC 27005**, and **NIST SP 800-30** frameworks.

## üíº 2. My Role and Contribution

I contributed as a **risk analysis lead** within the team, responsible for:
- Leading the *Risk Identification and Mitigation* sections of the report.  
- Coordinating shared resources via **Microsoft Teams** shared folder.  
- Ensuring alignment with **ISO 27005** and **GDPR** requirements.  
- Integrating **STRIDE** and **FMEA** for technical and business risk prioritisation.  
- Reviewing report quality, structure, and Harvard referencing format.  

This process enhanced my ability to merge **quantitative reasoning** with governance insights.

## üìä 4. Key Findings and Recommendations

### Identified Risks
- Weak endpoint security and unpatched systems.  
- Cloud misconfiguration and data exposure during digitalisation.  
- GDPR non-compliance due to lack of consent records.  
- Single Wi-Fi network used for staff and business systems.  

### Recommended Mitigations
- Enforce MFA and network segmentation.  
- Implement WAF and SSL/TLS encryption.  
- Perform regular **penetration testing** and **compliance reviews**.  
- Adopt **ISO 22301**-based Business Continuity Planning (BCP).

## üí¨ 7. Reflection

Working collaboratively deepened my understanding of **risk governance, teamwork, and communication**.  
I learned to align technical frameworks (ISO/NIST) with organisational objectives and ethical considerations, a skill directly applicable to my work at MBZUH.  

This project built the foundation for my later individual work ‚Äî particularly the **Executive Summary in Unit 11**, where I applied quantitative risk modelling to similar business scenarios.
