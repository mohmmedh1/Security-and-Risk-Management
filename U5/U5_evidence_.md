## üß† 1. Specific Aspect of GDPR Addressed  

This case focused on two key provisions of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR):  
- **Right of Access** (*Article 15 GDPR*)  
- **Lawful Processing** (*Article 6 GDPR*)  

A data subject submitted a **Subject Access Request (SAR)** to the **National Asset Management Agency (NAMA)**, requesting access to all personal data held about him.  
NAMA refused the request under **Section 42(k) of the Irish Data Protection Act 2018**, which allows certain public bodies to restrict access where disclosure could threaten market stability or compromise financial oversight.  

The **Data Protection Commission (DPC)** investigated whether this refusal complied with the **principles of transparency and proportionality**, ensuring that the exemption was applied only when strictly necessary.  

This case explored the balance between **individual privacy rights** and the **legitimate interests of state financial regulation**, underscoring the importance of narrow, evidence-based application of GDPR exemptions.

## ‚öñÔ∏è 2. How It Was Resolved  

The DPC reviewed the correspondence and determined that NAMA had acted **lawfully**, since Section 42(k) was appropriately applied in view of NAMA‚Äôs regulatory role.  

However, the DPC advised NAMA to improve **communication with data subjects** by clearly stating:  
- The **specific legal grounds** for refusal; and  
- The **data categories withheld** and the **rationale for non-disclosure**.  

No enforcement action was required, but the DPC stressed that **future refusals must reference** the legislative provision relied upon and the justification for applying it.  

This outcome illustrates that **GDPR rights are qualified, not absolute** ‚Äî limitations are permitted only when supported by transparency, documentation, and legitimate purpose.

## üèõÔ∏è 3. Actions I Would Take as an Information Security Manager  

If such a case arose within my organisation, I would ensure all Subject Access Requests (SARs) and exemptions are managed in full compliance with **GDPR Articles 12‚Äì15** and applicable national law.  

**Mitigation measures would include:**  

### üîπ Clear SAR Procedures and Templates  
Establish standard templates for SAR responses, detailing whether exemptions apply and specifying the legal justification.  

### üîπ Documented Exemption Register  
Maintain an internal log for all restricted SARs, referencing the **relevant legal basis** (e.g., Section 42 of the Data Protection Act 2018).  

### üîπ Transparency and Justification  
When exemptions apply, provide a clear, high-level explanation to the requester about why data cannot be released, ensuring proportionality and fairness.  

### üîπ Collaboration Between Legal and Security Teams  
Coordinate reviews between the **Data Protection Officer (DPO)**, **Legal**, and **Information Security** teams to validate the lawful basis for each decision.  

### üîπ Regular Compliance Training  
Deliver workshops to raise awareness about GDPR exemptions, lawful processing, and data-subject rights among relevant staff.  

### üîπ Audit and Oversight  
Implement periodic reviews to confirm that exemptions are **justified, consistent, and auditable**, preventing over-application or procedural errors.  

These measures would promote **accountability**, **consistency**, and **trust**, ensuring a fair balance between data-subject rights and public-interest obligations.

## üí¨ 4. Reflection  

This case reinforced that GDPR compliance extends beyond simply granting access ‚Äî it requires **transparency, proportionality, and governance discipline**.  
I learned that exemptions must always be **narrowly applied** and **fully documented**, with clear reasoning accessible to oversight bodies and data subjects alike.  

As an Information Security Manager, I now recognise the importance of **cross-functional collaboration** between technical and legal teams to ensure that every data-protection decision is **evidence-based and defensible**.  
This insight will guide future compliance procedures within my workplace, ensuring that all SARs are handled ethically and transparently.
