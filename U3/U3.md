\## üß† 1. Understanding Threats and Vulnerabilities  



This unit introduced the distinction between \*threats\* (potential causes of unwanted incidents) and \*vulnerabilities\* (weaknesses exploitable by threats).  

Effective threat modelling begins by identifying both and mapping their interactions across system components.



A key takeaway from the lecturecast was that threat modelling is \*\*proactive\*\* ‚Äî it anticipates possible attacker paths before incidents occur.  

Understanding threat vectors helps organisations strengthen design and architecture rather than reacting post-breach.

\## ‚öôÔ∏è 2. Threat Modelling Techniques  



\### \*\*STRIDE (Microsoft Framework)\*\*  

\- \*\*Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, Elevation of Privilege\*\*.  

\- Provides a structured taxonomy for analysing threats at each system element level.  

\- Particularly useful in \*\*software design\*\* and \*\*data-flow diagram (DFD)\*\* contexts.  



\### \*\*DREAD (Risk Rating Model)\*\*  

\- \*\*Damage, Reproducibility, Exploitability, Affected Users, Discoverability\*\*.  

\- Offers a quantitative rating (1‚Äì10) to prioritise mitigation.  

\- Criticised for subjectivity, but still helpful in rapid triage scenarios.  



\### \*\*Attack Trees\*\*  

\- Visualise attacker goals and sub-goals using logical decomposition (‚ÄúAND/OR‚Äù nodes).  

\- Effective for analysing complex, multi-stage attacks.  



\### \*\*PASTA (Process for Attack Simulation and Threat Analysis)\*\*  

\- A seven-stage hybrid model combining business impact analysis, attack simulation, and risk assessment.  

\- Aligns strongly with ISO 31000 and NIST SP 800-30 frameworks.

\## üî¨ 3. Comparative Evaluation  



| Model | Focus | Strengths | Limitations |

|--------|--------|------------|--------------|

| \*\*STRIDE\*\* | Threat classification | Simple, widely adopted, integrates with DFDs | Does not quantify risk magnitude |

| \*\*DREAD\*\* | Risk scoring | Enables prioritisation | Subjective, may vary across analysts |

| \*\*Attack Trees\*\* | Multi-stage attack logic | Illustrates dependencies | Complex for large systems |

| \*\*PASTA\*\* | Business-aligned modelling | Comprehensive, strategic | Resource-intensive |



Combining these approaches forms a \*\*hybrid model\*\* ‚Äî for example, STRIDE for identification and DREAD for prioritisation ‚Äî ensuring a balance between qualitative and quantitative assessment.

\## üèóÔ∏è 4. Application Example  



During the exercise, a sample web-application architecture was evaluated using \*\*STRIDE\*\* and \*\*DREAD\*\*:  

\- \*Spoofing\* via insecure authentication API scored 9 (high risk).  

\- \*Information Disclosure\* via misconfigured S3 bucket scored 8.  

\- \*DoS\* from excessive API calls scored 6.  



These findings guided targeted mitigations such as implementing OAuth 2.0, enforcing rate-limiting, and enabling encryption-at-rest.

\## üí¨ 5. Reflection  



This unit enhanced my analytical and modelling skills by bridging theoretical frameworks with practical use.  

I realised that \*\*threat modelling is not static\*\* ‚Äî it evolves as systems, users, and threats change.  

Applying STRIDE and PASTA frameworks at work will strengthen design-phase security, ensuring vulnerabilities are addressed early rather than through reactive patching.  

The structured nature of these methods aligns directly with my professional goal of leading risk-based cybersecurity governance initiatives.
