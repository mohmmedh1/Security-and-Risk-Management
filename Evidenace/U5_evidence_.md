Case Study Title: Access Request made to NAMA

Case Year Investigated: 2017

What is the specific aspect of GDPR that your case study addresses?

This case focused on the Right of Access (Article 15 GDPR) and Lawful Processing (Article 6 GDPR).

A data subject submitted a Subject Access Request (SAR) to the National Asset Management Agency (NAMA), seeking access to all personal data held about him. NAMA refused the request, citing Section 42(k) of the Irish Data Protection Act 2018, which allows certain public bodies to restrict access if disclosure could affect market stability or financial oversight functions.

The DPC investigated whether NAMA’s refusal complied with GDPR transparency and proportionality principles, ensuring that the exemption was applied narrowly and only where strictly necessary.

This case examined the tension between individual privacy rights and the legitimate interests of state financial regulation, highlighting the need for a clear justification when restricting subject access under GDPR.

2. How It Was Resolved

The Data Protection Commission (DPC) reviewed the correspondence and determined that NAMA had acted lawfully, as the exemption applied under Section 42(k) was relevant due to NAMA’s financial oversight role.

However, the DPC advised NAMA to improve its communication with data subjects by clearly outlining:

The specific legal grounds for refusal, and

The data categories withheld and rationale for non-disclosure.

The case concluded with the DPC confirming that no further action was necessary but emphasised that future refusals must include explicit references to the legislative basis and the reasoning for applying exemptions.

This case illustrates how GDPR rights are not absolute and can be limited under certain conditions — but only with transparency and documentation.

3. What I Would Do as an Information Security Manager to Mitigate Similar Issues

If this issue arose within my organisation, I would ensure that our handling of access requests and exemptions followed best practice under GDPR Articles 12–15 and relevant national data protection laws.

My mitigation measures would include:

Clear SAR Procedures and Templates:

Create standardised templates for responding to SARs, ensuring that all replies specify whether exemptions apply and under what legal justification.

Documented Exemption Register:

Maintain an internal log of all SARs where access was restricted, citing the corresponding legal provisions (e.g., Section 42 of the Data Protection Act 2018).

Transparency and Justification:

Even when exemptions apply, provide a high-level explanation to the requester about why data cannot be released — without compromising regulatory or operational confidentiality.

Collaboration Between Legal and Security Teams:

Coordinate between the Data Protection Officer (DPO), Legal, and Information Security teams to ensure each access decision is reviewed for proportionality and lawful basis.

Regular Compliance Training:

Conduct workshops on GDPR exemptions and lawful processing to raise awareness among staff, especially those managing financial or government data.

Audit and Oversight:

Implement periodic reviews to ensure exemption usage is justified and consistently applied, preventing misuse or over-application of restrictions.

These measures would strengthen compliance, uphold accountability, and ensure my organisation demonstrates a fair balance between data subject rights and public interest obligations.

4. Reflection

This case reinforced my understanding that GDPR compliance extends beyond simple access rights — it involves balancing transparency, proportionality, and lawful limitation.
Through this case, I learned that exemptions under GDPR must always be applied transparently and narrowly, accompanied by clear documentation.

As an Information Security Manager, this highlights the importance of cross-functional governance and communication between technical and legal departments, ensuring every GDPR-related decision is evidence-based and auditable.
