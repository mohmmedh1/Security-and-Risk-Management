# üß© Unit 6: Development Team Project ‚Äì Risk Identification Report

**Assignment:** Development Team Project: Risk Identification Report  
**Submission Date:** 2 September 2025  
**Group:** Team 1  

---

## üß† Overview
This team project assessed cyber risks related to the digitalisation of *Pampered Pets Ltd.*, a small enterprise expanding from manual operations to an e-commerce and ERP environment. The work evaluated both the current and future states of the business using **ISO 27005:2022**, **NIST CSF v2.0**, and **STRIDE** threat modelling.

---

## üíº My Role
I:
- Participated in all **team meetings** and used the **shared Microsoft Teams folder**.  
- Led the **Risk Identification and Analysis** section.  
- Applied **ISO 27005** and **STRIDE** to identify threats and classify vulnerabilities.  
- Added **GDPR, ISO 22301, and vendor-risk controls** to the mitigation section.  
- Reviewed and proofread the final report for structure and citation accuracy.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Frameworks Applied
- **ISO 27005 (2022):** SME-appropriate risk identification and evaluation.  
- **NIST CSF v2.0:** Structured functions ‚Äì Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover.  
- **STRIDE:** Technical threat classification (Spoofing ‚Üí Elevation of Privilege).  
- **FMEA:** Prioritised mitigation using Risk Priority Numbers (RPN).  

---

## üìä Key Findings
- Major risks: legacy systems, weak Wi-Fi security, and limited user awareness.  
- Digitalisation risks: cloud misconfiguration, GDPR non-compliance, supply-chain exposure.  
- Recommended **defence-in-depth** controls ‚Äì MFA, WAF, hybrid backups, encryption, and phishing-awareness training.  
- Proposed a **phased implementation plan** aligned with NIST‚Äôs continuous-improvement model.

## üí¨ Reflection
This project improved my ability to apply structured frameworks collaboratively and communicate technical risk data to non-technical audiences. It strengthened my understanding of **quantitative reasoning** and **governance alignment**, forming the foundation for my later **Executive Summary (Unit 11)** work.
