1. Key Challenges in BCP and DR Planning

The case study by Alhazmi and Malaiya (2013) identifies key challenges in developing effective BCP and DR strategies:

Inadequate risk assessment: Organisations often underestimate dependencies between systems and processes.

Insufficient testing and simulation: Plans exist but are rarely validated through live drills.

Human and communication failures: Decision delays and lack of clarity during crises reduce recovery efficiency.

The study highlights that BCP and DR must evolve beyond static documentation into dynamic, tested frameworks integrated with organisational strategy.

2. Main Findings from the Case

The authors evaluated several enterprise-level DR implementations and found that recovery time objectives (RTOs) and recovery point objectives (RPOs) were often undefined or unrealistic.
They stressed that success depends on three principles:

Prioritising critical assets and dependencies.

Regular, scenario-based testing.

Integrating continuity planning with risk governance frameworks such as ISO 22301.

Their analysis also revealed that automation—especially in backup scheduling and failover systems—significantly improves response time and accuracy.

3. Importance of BCP and DR Integration

Alhazmi and Malaiya (2013) argue that separating DR from BCP weakens organisational resilience. DR focuses on technical recovery, while BCP ensures business function continuity. Integrating both provides a holistic approach: IT recovery aligns with operational recovery.
Such integration supports communication between technical and managerial stakeholders, reduces downtime, and ensures that recovery measures support business objectives. This directly reflects principles of ISO 31000 and NIST SP 800-34 frameworks.

4. Reflection

This seminar deepened my understanding of how BCP and DR form the operational backbone of organisational resilience. Before this, I viewed DR primarily as restoring data or systems after failure. Through Alhazmi and Malaiya (2013), I realised that effective continuity planning requires ongoing risk analysis, stakeholder coordination, and scenario-based testing. The emphasis on integrating BCP, DR, and risk governance frameworks aligns with my role in digital infrastructure security. I now recognise the need for measurable RTOs, documented communication hierarchies, and automated failover mechanisms. This learning will guide my future approach to continuity management — ensuring recovery planning is strategic, proactive, and aligned with business objectives.
