## üß† 1. Main Challenges in Modelling and Evaluating Social Engineering Threats (SETs)  

*Aijaz and Nazir (2024)* identify several challenges when modelling **Social Engineering Threats (SETs):**  

- **Human unpredictability:** Emotions, trust, and awareness vary across individuals and contexts, making human behaviour difficult to quantify.  
- **Lack of structured models:** Traditional frameworks overlook psychological and contextual manipulation factors.  
- **Evolving attack dynamics:** Attackers continuously adapt techniques, rendering static models obsolete.  

To address these challenges, the authors propose a **hybrid quantitative framework** that combines **Attack Tree Modelling** and **Markov Chain Modelling** to simulate how SETs progress probabilistically through various stages.

## üß© 2. Persuasion Principles and Modalities in SETs  

Drawing on **Cialdini‚Äôs persuasion principles** ‚Äî authority, scarcity, reciprocity, and social proof ‚Äî the study explains how attackers exploit **cognitive biases** to manipulate users.  
By categorising **social-engineering modalities** such as phishing, baiting, and pretexting, Aijaz and Nazir demonstrate how these tactics affect perception and decision-making.  

Systematic analysis of persuasion principles enables organisations to:  
- Identify **behavioural vulnerabilities**;  
- Design **targeted awareness training**; and  
- Quantify how specific psychological levers influence **attack success rates**.  

This integration of **psychological theory** with **quantitative modelling** enhances prediction accuracy for SET-related incidents, bridging human factors and data analytics.

## ‚öôÔ∏è 3. Role of Attack Tree and Markov Chain Models  

### **Attack Tree Model:**  
Breaks down complex social-engineering attacks into logical sub-events (e.g., *initial contact ‚Üí data request ‚Üí credential theft*).  
Each node or branch is assigned a probability based on historical evidence or expert judgement.  

### **Markov Chain Model:**  
Represents transition probabilities between attack states ‚Äî such as moving from initial deception to exploitation ‚Äî capturing the **dynamic nature of human interactions** in SETs.  

Together, these models quantify:  
- **Attack Occurrence Probability (AOP)** ‚Äì the likelihood that an attack attempt occurs;  
- **Attack Success Probability (ASP)** ‚Äì the likelihood of successful compromise under specific behavioural or contextual conditions.  

This dual modelling approach fuses **qualitative human elements** with **quantitative statistical reasoning**, producing measurable outputs for **decision-making and risk prioritisation**.

## üèõÔ∏è 4. Policy and Framework Implications  

The study‚Äôs outcomes provide strong guidance for institutional cybersecurity policy and governance frameworks:  

- Develop **evidence-based training programmes** that simulate persuasion tactics in realistic scenarios.  
- Establish **risk thresholds** for SET incidents using quantified ASP and AOP metrics.  
- Integrate **behavioural analytics** into SOC monitoring to detect manipulation indicators or insider threats.  
- Adopt **adaptive awareness frameworks** that evolve with emerging social-engineering trends.  

Embedding quantitative SET models into **enterprise risk management systems** allows organisations to transition from reactive awareness to **proactive, data-driven prevention**.

## üí¨ 5. Reflection  

This seminar transformed my understanding of how **quantitative models can represent human-centric risks**.  
Previously, I viewed social engineering primarily as a qualitative challenge. However, through Aijaz and Nazir‚Äôs framework, I learned that **Markov Chains** and **Attack Trees** can effectively quantify behavioural and contextual risks.  

The focus on **persuasion principles** reinforced that human factors are **measurable and integral to cybersecurity risk analysis**.  
By combining behavioural science with statistical modelling, I can now approach awareness and governance frameworks through a **data-driven lens**, aligning psychology with cybersecurity strategy.  

This insight directly supports my professional goal of implementing **adaptive, evidence-based awareness programmes** that reduce the success probability of social-engineering attacks.
