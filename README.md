## ðŸ“˜ Module Overview
This e-Portfolio demonstrates my applied learning throughout the *Security Risk Management* module, highlighting how I integrated ISO 31000, NIST SP 800-30, GDPR, and quantitative risk-modelling techniques into professional cybersecurity practice.  
The artefacts below evidence both theoretical understanding and practical implementation through seminars, workshops, case studies, and quantitative exercises.

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Outcomes
1. **Identify and analyse** information-security risks using structured frameworks such as ISO 31000 and ISO/IEC 27005.  
2. **Apply** qualitative and quantitative methodologies (STRIDE, Monte Carlo, Bayesian analysis) to assess uncertainty and prioritise mitigation.  
3. **Develop and evaluate** business-aligned controls for continuity and disaster recovery.  
4. **Integrate ethical, legal, and professional principles** into security-governance decisions.  
5. **Reflect critically** on learning to enhance professional practice and leadership.

## ðŸ§  Professional Reflection
Across the module I evolved from a technically focused engineer into a **strategic cybersecurity leader**.  
Applying ISO 31000 and quantitative models improved my ability to present measurable, evidence-based risk insights.  
Group collaboration developed emotional intelligence and communication; seminars deepened understanding of AI, CPS, and GDPR governance.  
This portfolio demonstrates my readiness to lead data-driven, ethically grounded cybersecurity programmes at institutional level.
