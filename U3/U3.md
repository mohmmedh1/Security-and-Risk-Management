## 🧠 1. Understanding Threats and Vulnerabilities  

This unit introduced the distinction between *threats* (potential causes of unwanted incidents) and *vulnerabilities* (weaknesses exploitable by threats).  
Effective threat modelling begins by identifying both and mapping their interactions across system components.

A key takeaway from the lecturecast was that threat modelling is **proactive** — it anticipates possible attacker paths before incidents occur.  
Understanding threat vectors helps organisations strengthen design and architecture rather than reacting post-breach.

## ⚙️ 2. Threat Modelling Techniques  

### **STRIDE (Microsoft Framework)**  
- **Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, Elevation of Privilege**.  
- Provides a structured taxonomy for analysing threats at each system element level.  
- Particularly useful in **software design** and **data-flow diagram (DFD)** contexts.  

### **DREAD (Risk Rating Model)**  
- **Damage, Reproducibility, Exploitability, Affected Users, Discoverability**.  
- Offers a quantitative rating (1–10) to prioritise mitigation.  
- Criticised for subjectivity, but still helpful in rapid triage scenarios.  

### **Attack Trees**  
- Visualise attacker goals and sub-goals using logical decomposition (“AND/OR” nodes).  
- Effective for analysing complex, multi-stage attacks.  

### **PASTA (Process for Attack Simulation and Threat Analysis)**  
- A seven-stage hybrid model combining business impact analysis, attack simulation, and risk assessment.  
- Aligns strongly with ISO 31000 and NIST SP 800-30 frameworks.

## 🔬 3. Comparative Evaluation  

| Model | Focus | Strengths | Limitations |
|--------|--------|------------|--------------|
| **STRIDE** | Threat classification | Simple, widely adopted, integrates with DFDs | Does not quantify risk magnitude |
| **DREAD** | Risk scoring | Enables prioritisation | Subjective, may vary across analysts |
| **Attack Trees** | Multi-stage attack logic | Illustrates dependencies | Complex for large systems |
| **PASTA** | Business-aligned modelling | Comprehensive, strategic | Resource-intensive |

For complex enterprise systems, combining **STRIDE**’s qualitative mapping with **DREAD**’s quantitative scoring ensures comprehensive coverage — identifying not only *where* threats exist but also *how severely* they impact operations.  
Such hybrid approaches offer a balanced view that connects design-phase awareness with measurable risk prioritisation.

## 🏗️ 4. Application Example  

During the exercise, a sample web-application architecture was evaluated using **STRIDE** and **DREAD**:  
- *Spoofing* via insecure authentication API scored 9 (high risk).  
- *Information Disclosure* via misconfigured S3 bucket scored 8.  
- *DoS* from excessive API calls scored 6.  

These findings guided targeted mitigations such as implementing OAuth 2.0, enforcing rate-limiting, and enabling encryption-at-rest.  
This combination of structured classification and quantitative scoring demonstrated how early design-stage modelling reduces residual risk exposure.

## 💬 5. Reflection  

This unit enhanced my analytical and modelling skills by bridging theoretical frameworks with practical use.  
I realised that **threat modelling is not static** — it evolves as systems, users, and threats change.  
Applying STRIDE and PASTA frameworks in my workplace will strengthen design-phase security, ensuring vulnerabilities are addressed early rather than through reactive patching.  

The structured nature of these methods aligns directly with my professional goal of leading risk-based cybersecurity governance initiatives.  
This understanding also reinforced the importance of integrating **continuous threat modelling into DevSecOps pipelines**, ensuring that risk identification and mitigation remain dynamic, automated, and evidence-driven.  

By embedding these principles, I can help my organisation achieve adaptive, data-informed security posture management that aligns with ISO 31000 and NIST 800-30 guidelines.
