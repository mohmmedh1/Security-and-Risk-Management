# üß© Unit 6: Security Standards Seminar ‚Äì GDPR, PCI-DSS, and HIPAA  

**Purpose:**  
To explore and compare key information-security standards ‚Äî **GDPR**, **PCI-DSS**, and **HIPAA** ‚Äî and evaluate their application to the company scenario used in the module assessment.  

---

## üß† Main Standards Reviewed  

### **GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)**  
Protects EU residents‚Äô personal data and governs how organisations collect, process, and store it.  
Relevant to any company that **operates in or provides services to EU citizens**.  

### **PCI-DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard)**  
Ensures secure **processing, storage, and transmission** of cardholder data.  
Critical for e-commerce and online payment environments.  

### **HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act)**  
U.S. healthcare data-protection framework, referenced for its **auditability**, **accountability**, and **governance** principles.  
Though not directly applicable, its best practices inform robust internal data-management processes.  

---

## ‚öñÔ∏è Evaluation Findings  

- The company must comply with **GDPR** and **PCI-DSS** due to its **EU operations** and **online payment systems**.  
- Key compliance gaps identified:  
  - Absence of formal **data-retention policies**.  
  - Weak **access controls** and **MFA** coverage.  
  - Lack of documented **audit trails** and **periodic compliance checks**.  
- Adopting **HIPAA-style accountability and logging** could enhance governance and transparency, even if not legally mandated.

## üß© Recommendations  

1. **Unified Compliance Framework:**  
   Integrate GDPR and PCI-DSS controls into a single governance model to reduce duplication and maintain consistency.  

2. **Technical Controls:**  
   Implement **encryption**, **multi-factor authentication (MFA)**, and **role-based access control (RBAC)** for sensitive data and payment systems.  

3. **Operational Controls:**  
   Conduct **regular internal audits**, **staff training**, and **vendor compliance reviews** to ensure continuous improvement.  

4. **Governance & Oversight:**  
   Appoint a **Data Protection Officer (DPO)** and establish formal **incident-response** and **breach-notification** procedures.  

---

## üßÆ Assumptions  

- The company processes both **EU personal data** and **online transactions**.  
- Operations are **cloud-based**, introducing shared compliance responsibilities between provider and client.  
- No healthcare data is processed; **HIPAA** is applied only as a **best-practice reference** for governance.

## üí¨ Reflection  

This activity deepened my understanding of how **international security standards overlap** to ensure confidentiality, integrity, and accountability.  
I learned that compliance is not a one-off checklist but an **ongoing, risk-based governance process** integrating **legal, technical, and organisational** perspectives.  

The seminar enhanced my ability to assess systems through a **risk-and-governance lens**, strengthening my capability to design compliance-aligned cybersecurity strategies.  
This insight will directly inform how I approach **policy design, audit readiness, and data-protection leadership** in my professional role.
